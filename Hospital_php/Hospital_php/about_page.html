          IPC was established in 1983 by Dr. Prathap C Reddy, IPC Hospitals
          revolutionized healthcare in India as the nation's first corporate
          hospital. Now Asia's leading integrated healthcare provider, IPC
          encompasses hospitals, pharmacies, clinics, telemedicine, and
          educational institutions. Pioneering clinical excellence and
          affordability, IPC has embraced technology, introducing cutting-edge
          innovations like South East Asia's first Proton Therapy Centre. With a
          patient-centric ethos, IPC has served over 150 million individuals
          from 140 countries, emphasizing Tender Loving Care (TLC). Beyond
          business, IPC promotes preventive healthcare through initiatives like
          the Billion Hearts Beating Foundation, addressing non-communicable
          diseases. Socially responsible, IPC supports underprivileged children
          through initiatives like SACHi and SAHI, while the Total Health
          Foundation pilots holistic healthcare models. Recognized by the
          Government of India and honored with stamps, Dr. Prathap C Reddy,
          IPC's Founder Chairman, was awarded the Padma Vibhushan for his
          contributions.
